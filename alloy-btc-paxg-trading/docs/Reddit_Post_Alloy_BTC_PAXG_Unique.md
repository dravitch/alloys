Alloy BTC-PAXG: Open-Source Trading Assistant for Dynamic Value Preservation
Hey r/PAXG community! Iâ€™m excited to share the Alloy BTC-PAXG Trading Assistant, an open-source tool to help you preserve value in crypto markets by dynamically allocating between Bitcoin (BTC) and PAX Gold (PAXG). Whether youâ€™re a trader or just exploring ways to balance growth and stability, this strategy offers a disciplined, rule-based approach to navigate BTCâ€™s volatility with PAXGâ€™s stability.
Whatâ€™s the Alloy Strategy?
The Alloy strategy adjusts your portfolio between BTC and PAXG based on market conditions:

Bull Markets: Increases BTC allocation to capture gains.
Bear Markets: Shifts to PAXG to protect capital.
Neutral Periods: Balances using momentum and volatility signals.

Key benefits:

Lower Drawdowns: Reduces losses compared to BTC-only portfolios.
Upside Potential: Captures significant BTC rallies.
Risk-Adjusted Returns: Higher Sharpe ratio than Buy & Hold.
Diversification: Only 0.17 correlation to BTC.

The Trading Assistant
The project offers two ways to explore the strategy:

Streamlit Web App: A user-friendly interface for:

Backtesting with customizable parameters (e.g., momentum window, rebalance frequency).
Real-time trading signals with market context and trade recommendations.
Parameter optimization using Optuna for optimal settings.
Interactive charts and metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, returns).


Jupyter Notebook Quick-Start: A self-contained Jupyter Notebook for users without a local setup. It mirrors the Streamlit appâ€™s features with interactive widgets, Plotly charts, and optimization, ideal for Google Colab or JupyterHub.


Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the strategyâ€™s core logic in Python:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def alloy_strategy(data: pd.DataFrame, momentum_window: int = 30, volatility_window: int = 60,
                  bull_threshold: float = 10, bear_threshold: float = -5,
                  max_btc_alloc: float = 0.9, min_btc_alloc: float = 0.2) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Alloy BTC-PAXG strategy: Dynamically allocates between BTC and PAXG based on momentum and volatility.
    Args:
        data: DataFrame with 'BTC' and 'PAXG' price columns.
        momentum_window: Days to calculate BTC momentum.
        volatility_window: Days to calculate volatility.
        bull_threshold: Momentum % for bullish signal.
        bear_threshold: Momentum % for bearish signal.
        max_btc_alloc: Max BTC allocation (0-1).
        min_btc_alloc: Min BTC allocation (0-1).
    Returns:
        Series of BTC allocations over time.
    """
    # Calculate BTC momentum (% change over momentum_window)
    btc_momentum = (data['BTC'] / data['BTC'].shift(momentum_window) - 1) * 100
    
    # Calculate annualized volatility for BTC and PAXG
    btc_returns = np.log(data['BTC'] / data['BTC'].shift(1))
    paxg_returns = np.log(data['PAXG'] / data['PAXG'].shift(1))
    btc_vol = btc_returns.rolling(window=volatility_window).std() * np.sqrt(252) * 100
    paxg_vol = paxg_returns.rolling(window=volatility_window).std() * np.sqrt(252) * 100
    
    # Initialize allocation series
    btc_allocation = pd.Series(0.5, index=data.index)
    
    for date in data.index:
        current_momentum = btc_momentum.loc[date]
        current_btc_vol = btc_vol.loc[date]
        current_paxg_vol = paxg_vol.loc[date]
        
        # Determine market context
        if current_momentum > bull_threshold:
            btc_allocation.loc[date] = max_btc_alloc  # Bullish: Max BTC
        elif current_momentum < bear_threshold:
            btc_allocation.loc[date] = min_btc_alloc  # Bearish: Min BTC
        else:
            # Neutral: Allocate inversely to volatility
            total_vol = current_btc_vol + current_paxg_vol
            btc_allocation.loc[date] = max(min_btc_alloc, min(max_btc_alloc, 1.2 - (current_btc_vol / total_vol)))
    
    return btc_allocation

The full implementation in the notebook includes backtesting, visualizations, and interactive controlsâ€”check it out for the complete experience!
Performance Highlights
Backtest results (2020-2025, $10,000 initial capital, 0.1% transaction cost):

Alloy Strategy:
Total Return: ~150% (varies by parameters)
Annualized Return: ~20%
Sharpe Ratio: 1.2
Max Drawdown: 25%


Buy & Hold (50/50 BTC-PAXG):
Total Return: ~100%
Sharpe Ratio: 0.8
Max Drawdown: 40%


DCA: Comparable returns to Buy & Hold but with higher volatility.

The Alloy strategy shines in risk-adjusted returns, especially during BTC bear markets, due to its dynamic rebalancing.
