# Trading Signals Guide

This guide explains how to interpret and act on the signals generated by the Alloy BTC-PAXG Trading Assistant.

## Signal Structure

Each trading signal is structured to provide comprehensive information for making informed allocation decisions. Here's how to read and interpret each component:

### 1. Signal Header

```
=== ALLOY BTC-PAXG TRADING SIGNAL ===
Date: 2023-05-15
```

This section shows:
- The date when the signal was generated
- When to implement the recommended actions

### 2. Market Context

```
MARKET CONTEXT:
BTC/USD: $28,432.15 (30d: -4.7%)
PAXG/USD: $1,982.53 (30d: 2.1%)
BTC Momentum: -3.2%
```

This section provides:
- **Current prices** for BTC and PAXG
- **30-day performance** (percentage change over the last 30 days)
- **BTC Momentum** - key indicator for allocation decisions

Understanding the market context helps you validate the signal against your own market observations.

### 3. Decision

```
DECISION: Bearish momentum: -3.2% < -5%
```

This section explains:
- The type of signal (bullish, bearish, or neutral)
- The specific condition that triggered the signal
- The threshold values used for comparison

### 4. Recommended Allocation

```
RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION:
BTC: 20.0%
PAXG: 80.0%
```

This section shows:
- The target allocation percentages for each asset
- How your portfolio should be structured after rebalancing

### 5. Required Actions

```
ACTIONS REQUIRED:
- SELL BTC: 0.124532 units @ $28,432.15
- BUY PAXG: 1.723651 units @ $1,982.53
```

This section provides:
- Specific trades to execute
- Exact quantities and reference prices
- The type of action (BUY or SELL) for each asset

## Signal Types

The Alloy strategy generates three types of signals, each with different implications:

### Bullish Signal

**Trigger**: BTC momentum > +10% (default threshold)

**Example**:
```
DECISION: Strong bullish momentum: 12.5% > 10%

RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION:
BTC: 90.0%
PAXG: 10.0%
```

**Interpretation**: Strong upward trend detected in BTC price. Strategy shifts to maximum BTC allocation to capture upside momentum.

**Action**: Typically requires buying more BTC and selling some PAXG.

### Bearish Signal

**Trigger**: BTC momentum < -5% (default threshold)

**Example**:
```
DECISION: Bearish momentum: -7.3% < -5%

RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION:
BTC: 20.0%
PAXG: 80.0%
```

**Interpretation**: Downward trend detected in BTC price. Strategy shifts to minimum BTC allocation to protect capital.

**Action**: Typically requires selling BTC and buying more PAXG.

### Neutral Signal

**Trigger**: BTC momentum between -5% and +10% (default thresholds)

**Example**:
```
DECISION: Allocation based on relative volatility (BTC: 45.2%, PAXG: 18.7%)

RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION:
BTC: 45.0%
PAXG: 55.0%
```

**Interpretation**: No clear trend detected. Strategy allocates based on relative volatility between assets.

**Action**: Rebalancing direction depends on current allocations and volatility levels.

## How to Use Trading Signals

### 1. Regular Monitoring

Check for new signals at least every 3 days (default rebalancing frequency). The web application provides the latest signal based on current market data.

### 2. Implementation Process

1. **Review the signal** - Understand the market context and reasoning
2. **Calculate current allocation** - Determine your current portfolio breakdown
3. **Compare to target** - Check how far your current allocation deviates from the recommendation
4. **Execute trades** - If deviation is significant (>5%), execute the recommended trades
5. **Record the transaction** - Keep track of all trades for performance monitoring

### 3. Practical Considerations

- **Transaction Costs**: Consider exchange fees and slippage when executing trades
- **Tax Implications**: Rebalancing may trigger taxable events in some jurisdictions
- **Execution Timing**: Try to execute trades close to when the signal is generated
- **Order Types**: Consider using limit orders to control execution prices
- **Minimum Trade Size**: Some exchanges have minimum trade requirements

### 4. Customization Options

Trading signals can be customized by adjusting:

- **Momentum Window**: How far back to look for calculating momentum
- **Momentum Thresholds**: Sensitivity to market trends
- **Allocation Limits**: Maximum and minimum allocations
- **Rebalancing Frequency**: How often to check for rebalancing opportunities

## Example Signal Walkthrough

Let's analyze a sample signal:

```
=== ALLOY BTC-PAXG TRADING SIGNAL ===
Date: 2023-06-10

MARKET CONTEXT:
BTC/USD: $26,785.42 (30d: -8.3%)
PAXG/USD: $1,975.16 (30d: 1.2%)
BTC Momentum: -6.5%

DECISION: Bearish momentum: -6.5% < -5%

RECOMMENDED ALLOCATION:
BTC: 20.0%
PAXG: 80.0%

ACTIONS REQUIRED:
- SELL BTC: 0.235461 units @ $26,785.42
- BUY PAXG: 3.184975 units @ $1,975.16
```

**Interpretation**:
1. BTC has shown negative momentum (-6.5%) over the last 30 days
2. This momentum is below the bearish threshold (-5%)
3. The strategy is recommending a defensive position with minimum BTC allocation
4. The specific trades needed are to sell 0.235461 BTC and buy 3.184975 PAXG

**Action Steps**:
1. Verify your current holdings
2. Execute the trades at market prices
3. Record the new allocation (20% BTC, 80% PAXG)
4. Wait for the next signal

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Consistent**: Follow signals systematically rather than selectively
2. **Consider Partial Implementation**: For large portfolios, implement changes gradually
3. **Maintain Cash Buffer**: Keep a small cash reserve for rebalancing operations
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track strategy performance against benchmarks
5. **Periodic Review**: Revisit strategy parameters quarterly to ensure alignment with goals

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Signal recommends very small trades
**Solution**: Set a minimum trade threshold (e.g., only rebalance if >5% change required)

**Issue**: High trading frequency
**Solution**: Increase the rebalance frequency parameter or rebalance threshold

**Issue**: Missed rebalancing opportunity
**Solution**: Implement at next signal, or wait for significant allocation divergence
