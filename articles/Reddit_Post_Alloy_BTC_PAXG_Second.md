# Alloy BTC-PAXG: The Saga Continues – Full Project Drop! 🌟

What’s up, r/PAXG legends? The **Alloy BTC-PAXG Trading Assistant** is back, and we’re going *all in*! You loved the [Colab notebook]([your-colab-link]) from our last post, and now we’re unleashing the full project: a slick Streamlit app, a GitHub repo, and a call to make this the ultimate crypto tool. Ready to crank your portfolio to 11? Let’s roll! 🚀

## Alloy: Still the King of Crypto Balance 👑

Quick recap: Alloy flips between BTC’s rocket rides and PAXG’s golden shield, using momentum and volatility to keep your stack safe and growing:
- **Bull Markets**: BTC heavy for those moonshot gains.
- **Bear Markets**: PAXG vibes for capital protection.
- **Neutral Zones**: Smart rebalancing for max chill.

Backtest results (2020-2025, $10k, 0.1% fees) still slap:
- **Alloy**: ~150% return, 1.2 Sharpe, 25% max drawdown.
- **Buy & Hold**: ~100% return, 0.8 Sharpe, 40% drawdown.
- **DCA**: Respectable, but Alloy’s the GOAT.

With a 0.17 correlation to BTC, Alloy’s your HODL sidekick with brains. 🧠
